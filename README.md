# CS360-Event-Tracking-Project


•	Briefly Summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The Schedufy app was designed to help users manage their schedules. This is possible by allowing users to add, edit, and delete the events they create. The primary goal of this app was to create the simplest, user-friendly app that users will find useful, could rely on, and enjoy to organize their daily activities. Whether that is school, work, or personal. Schedufy addresses the need for an efficient and easy to use scheduling tool that users can take anywhere they want, as having it available for on the go ensures that they can manage their events anytime and anywhere.

•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The following screens and features were necessary to support user needs:
- Login and Signup Screens: this ensures user authentication and a personalized experience.
- Home Screen: this is the main screen that opens up when the user opens the app. It is responsible of showing the users events which they can edit and delete from there as well.
- Add Event Screen: this is where the user taps to add an event they want to create and will later show in the home screen dashboard immediately after creating it.
- Settings Screen: this is where the user will access their edit profile and push notifications including SMS notifications.
- Bottom Navigation Menu: this appears in the home and add event screens. It allows users to effortlessly navigate back and forth across screens without getting lost.

My UI designs kept users in mind by focusing on simplicity and ease of navigation. This included having a clear and intuitive interface. My designs were successful because they provide a seamless experience by also minimizing the learning curve for new users due to all functionalities being easily accessible.

•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I approached the process of coding my app in a structured manner. First came the creation of a milestone where I identified the potential users, their needs, and use cases, the app’s features, flows, and layout. Then on a second part came designing the app and creating layouts for the different screens that the app needed. Then finally, came the actual coding and building part and of course testing. 

As for the techniques I used for coding the app, I focused on first understanding the user needs and defining their clear requirements. After, I broke down Schedufy into small manageable parts (components) such a as the database helper, the activities for different screens, and all the rest. As I added each feature and component, I tested out the app to make sure no errors or bugs were inserted as a result and if there was then it was debugging time until it was resolved, and I could continue with the rest of the work.

I believe that I can apply these techniques and strategies to other projects in the future since these strategies ensured a systemic and efficient development process and helps maintain clarity, efficiency, and high quality code that are up to date with modern practices.

•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I tested my code to ensure that my code was functional by combining manual testing with logging on to the console. The manual testing involved running the app across different emulators to make sure the UI responsiveness and functionality efficiently ran across different devices. The logging on to the console involved checking where the added event was being introduced, what types of information was being introduced, the number of events, when they database was refreshed and loaded, etc. All of this was to make sure that the database was efficiently running and without problems.

This process is important because it helps identify any bugs that are present in the app even when they are not visible. This in turn helps us fix these bugs before not only launching the app but also before it gets out of hand and impedes further development. All of this also results in a smooth user experience in the end and it revealed particular areas where the app needed improvement and helped ensure that as features worked as intended.

•	Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Considering the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization, I innovated in was trying to make sure compatibility with older Android versions while incorporating modern features. I tried my best in finding solutions that worked across different versions without compromising functionality. One example I can think of is having to implement manual navigation through onClick listeners instead of relying on AndroidX Navigation components since they had compatibility issues.

•	In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The specific component of Schedufy that I was particularly successful in demonstrating my knowledge, skills, and experience was implementing the SQLite database for managing the events. I believe that for this being my first time working on the back-end of things since I mostly focused on the front-end kind of things during web dev, this was a particularly successful accomplishment. This helped me realize that working with databases isn’t as scary as I thought it was and helped me showcase my ability to handle persist data storage and retrieval, which ensures data integrity and as a result a smooth user interaction with the event management features of Schedufy.
